Why two moons?

We will be getting married on the first Saturday after the full moon in July 2016\. We will then celebrate with a Buddhist ceremony in Wales on the first Saturday after the new moon in August 2016\.

Scott's Dharma name is Dawer Shonu. Meaning Youthful Moon. 

One becomes two become one.
